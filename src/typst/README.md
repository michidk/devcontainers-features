# typst (typst)

Installs typst, a new markup-based typesetting system that is powerful and easy to learn.

## Example Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/michidk/devcontainers-features/typst:0": {}
}
```

## Options

| Options Id | Description | Type | Default Value |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| version | Select version of typst. | string | latest |

## OS and Arch Support

**For v0.3 and up**, ARM and AMD architectures are supported. Ubuntu and Debian images are tested in CI.

### v0.1 and v0.2

For versions 0.1 and 0.2, only AMD/x86 architecture is supported.

"Older" Ubuntu versions (e.g. 20.04) may not work due to typst's glibc requirements (see [typst/typst#109](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/109)). For these versions, run `ldd --version` to check the glibc version.
